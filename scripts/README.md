##### Jenkins Jobs
You can manually paste the scripts from the jenkins dashboard but, this is not ideal when you'll have to manage hundreds of jobs.

Consider writing your own tool using sth like: [https://jenkins-job-builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](Jenkins Job Builder) to programmatically manage your jenkins jobs.
